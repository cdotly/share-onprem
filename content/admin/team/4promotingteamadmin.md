2. Next, select the Member Management button, which will bring up the Member Management screen. 

3. Once the Member Management screen is displayed, select the "Member Permissions" header.

4. With the "Member Permissions" header selected, an admin may add the user's name to the requested field. The admin may promote multiple members by separating each user's name with a comma. Once the admin has each user they wish to promote to admin in the requested field, select "Promote to Admin".
