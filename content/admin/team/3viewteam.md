## How do I view Team members? 

1. First, select the gear icon next to the Team name in the upper left corner of Share. (This is shown in the following screen shot to the right of the team name, "Test Team.")

2. Next, select the "Team Directory" button.  

3. Once the Team Directory is displayed, you'll be able to see who is on your team. Keep in mind, this is for the team, not individual spaces. Only team admins will have a star next to their name.
