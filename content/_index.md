# Share Documentation

This documentation covers [instruction for setting up a SpiderOak Share server](/server.html), [admin documentation](/admin.html) for administering and managing teams and spaces, and [end user documentation](/user.html). While not exhaustive, we hope this will give you a good foundation in all aspects of administering and using SpiderOak Share.
