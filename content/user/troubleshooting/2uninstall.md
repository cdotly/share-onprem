If you want to remove all traces of SpiderOak Share from your computer, uninstall it for troubleshooting purposes, or if you are trying to sign in to a new account and the application is still trying to connect to your old account,  you will need to uninstall Share from your device (or devices.)

### Personal Spaces

Keep in mind, uninstalling SpiderOak Share this way will remove any/all Personal Spaces associated with this device.

### Account Recovery Key
If you're performing this step for troubleshooting purposes, the account Recovery Key (copied during account creation) is needed to access the account after removing the application data from your device. Your account Recovery Key will be used to add your Share account back onto the current device, and to add it to other devices.
