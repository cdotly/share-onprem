### Files Not Loading
If you're experiencing files not loading within a Space, the first step is to close the application completely by quitting Share, and then relaunching Share. It may help to restart your device.

### Files Not Loading After Joining a New Space/Team
Due to our encryption, the initial key sharing can only take place when a members of the Team/Space with the encryption key is online at the same time as the new member to the Team/Space. Only one Team Member needs to have SpiderOak Share open at the same time as the new user to propagate the keys. Therefore, if you were recently invited into a Space and the files are not loading, make sure someone else who can see the files within the Space has SpiderOak Share running at the same time as you. 

### Space Error
Encountering a Space Error can be frustrating. This is fixed by switching to a different Space and then back to the Space affected by the Space Error. If the Space Error remains, this is resolved by closing the application completely by quitting Share, and then relaunching Share. It may help to restart your device.

### Save Version of File from Share to Your Computer
It's important to understand that you will have the original copy on your local computer *and* an updated copy in SpiderOak Share when you save a document or file from Share to your computer or phone. You can always download the latest copy of the file from Share by opening the file within Share and saving it to your device from the governing application (e.g. double-click a .docx file within Share, it opens in Word and use "Save As..." to save the new version in your Documents.)

### Re-add users
Users who are removed from Teams *and* Spaces can be re-added to those same Teams and Spaces. The Team/Space Admin can send the invite request through Member Management. (The Admin will need the Account ID/Key to re-invite a user.) The user need not make a new account for either process.
