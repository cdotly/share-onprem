Currently, creating a Team within SpiderOak Share requires a Setup URL, which will navigate your Team to the correct server and back-end. Team URLs and Setup URLs share information and look similar, but their functions are different. Providing SpiderOak share the correct Setup URL ensures that your Team Members can connect to the correct Shared Spaces and start collaborating. Creating a Team requires an active account and the Setup URL, which should be attained from your internal IT team.

## How do I create a Team? 

1. After account creation the user will reach the Add Team/Create Team page. The user is required to input the Setup URL into the "Create Team" section where it's requested.
