Chat is offered within a Shared Space to facilitate ad-hoc conversations with Space Members. This is intended to allow Space members to discuss possible file conflicts and additional collaborative ideas. Just like the files that are uploaded to a SpiderOak Share, the Chat messages are encrypted locally before being submitted to the server, and only distributed to Space members.

## How do I chat? 

1. Simply access the Space Settings drop down menu and select the "Chat" option.

2. Once the "Chat" button is selected, a Chat window will pull out from the right side of the client. A user may message their Team Members that occupy the same Shared Space by typing a message and pressing "Enter" or selecting the "Send" button.
