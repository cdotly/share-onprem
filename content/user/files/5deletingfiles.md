## How do I delete a file? 

1. First, select the correct Space. If no other Team Member has been added to this Space, it will be found under "Personal Spaces." If other Team Members exist in this Space then it will be under the "Shared Spaces."

2. Next, identify the file you wish to delete. Once you've found the file, select the ellipsis menu (3 dots) to the right of the file state icon and open the drop down menu.

3. Select "Delete File".

4. Since the user is requesting to delete a file from the Space, the application requires confirmation before completing the task. Keep in mind, deleting a file will remove it entirely from the Space. All members of the Space will have access to the file revoked.
