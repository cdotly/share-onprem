      <description>Users of a Space may be audited by the admins of that Space. (Note that a Space becomes a Shared Space once another team member is added to it. If no team members are added to a new Space, then the Space remains a Personal Space for the user who created the Space.)
How do I view Space members?  First, select the correct Space via the &amp;ldquo;Shared Spaces&amp;rdquo;. (&amp;ldquo;Test Space&amp;rdquo; is selected in the screen shot below.</description>

      <description>Space admins have the ability to add, remove, and promote fellow members to admins within the given Space. A Space admin cannot add, remove, or promote members on the team level.
How do I promote a member to a Space Admin?  Navigate to the correct Shared Space. (You must be in the space to administer it, and users must be members to be promoted.)
 In the Shared Space, select the dropdown arrow next to the Space name above, and then select &amp;ldquo;Space Members.</description>
