      <title>Uploading Files to a Space</title>

      <description>Uploading data to a Space requires an account to be a member of the Team and the Space. Team Members may upload documents and important files to Personal and Shared Spaces. Once a file is uploaded to a Space, it may be download and edited to create a new version of the file or removed entirely by any of the Space occupants.
How do I upload a file?  First, select the correct Space.</description>

      <description>SpiderOak Share is intended to make secure collaboration simple. Users upload files to a secure Space and choose to allow Team Members access. SpiderOak Share presents a &amp;ldquo;File State&amp;rdquo; to show users when changes have been made or when immediate attention is necessary. The most common file state is the &amp;ldquo;Green Check Mark&amp;rdquo; (shown below) which indicates that the local file is up to date and there are no newer versions available for download.</description>

      <title>Conflict Resolution</title>

      <description>A file conflict occurs when a user is actively editing a file and another Team Member commits changes to the same file.
How do I resolve a conflict? The &amp;ldquo;Resolve&amp;rdquo; file state will appear to the right of the file name and show that this file is currently involved in a conflict. By clicking on the &amp;ldquo;Resolve&amp;rdquo; button, the user will be taken to the Conflict Resolution screen.
The Conflict Resolution Screen will allow the user who most recently saved to select &amp;ldquo;Review&amp;rdquo; which will show the changes the Team Member had made.</description>

      <title>File Version and Reverting to a Previous Version</title>

      <description>SpiderOak Share retains file version history for all files uploaded to a Space. A file version is created any time a Space Member commits changes they&amp;rsquo;ve made to an uploaded file. This is extremely useful for when accidents occur such as incorrectly handled file conflicts, or erroneous edits cause a loss of information.
How do I see file version history? File Version History is accessed by selecting the ellipsis (3 dots) drop down menu which is on the right of the file state icon.</description>

      <title>Deleting Files</title>

      <description>How do I delete a file?  First, select the correct Space. If no other Team Member has been added to this Space, it will be found under &amp;ldquo;Personal Spaces.&amp;rdquo; If other Team Members exist in this Space then it will be under the &amp;ldquo;Shared Spaces.&amp;rdquo;
 Next, identify the file you wish to delete. Once you&amp;rsquo;ve found the file, select the ellipsis menu (3 dots) to the right of the file state icon and open the drop down menu.</description>
